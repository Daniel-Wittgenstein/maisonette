## About this Documentation

This is the official Maisonette Documentation.

## License

Maisonette is open-source under an MIT license.

Visit the Maisonette project on GitHub for more details.

## An Introductory Warning

Maisonette is currently experimental technology and
there is no telling if it will ever be finished.

I added this disclaimer because I really don't feel like setting people's
expectations too high and disappointing them.

## Additional Disclaimer

English is not my mother tongue. I hope this documentation
is still understandable.

## Maisonette - what is it?

Generally speaking, there are two main types of
Interactive Fiction:
parser-based (where you type stuff) and
choice-based (where you click on links).

Maisonette chooses a third approach: it lets
you create games that are kind of a hybrid
between the two. The games are played by clicking
like choice games, but they
feature a world model like parser games.

The most similar tool to Maisonette right now
is GrueScript by Robin Johnson.

While GrueScript is totally effing awesome,
I still felt the urge to create Maisonette,
because I wanted a design system that met a couple
of criteria GrueScript didn't meet.

So here it goes:

1.) The Maisonette Creator does not run in the browser.
Instead it runs on your desktop computer. This has
several advantages:

- Handling of images and audio becomes
way easier.

- Customizing your game's look down
to the last detail becomes easier (you can just load
any amount of CSS files into your project).

- JavaScript interoperability becomes also way easier
(just load any amount of JS files).

- You can create Maisonette games with any editor
you want. (But Maisonette Creator has a built-in simple
editor to get you started.)

2.) Maisonette's language is very different from GrueScript.
It allows you to define rules in a simple way, but
it also keeps almost all of the power of JavaScript.
(You don't have to know any JavaScript to use Maisonette, though.)

And that's the end of the ad. The rest of the document
will explain how to use Maisonette to create your own game / piece
of Interactive Fiction.

# Installing and Launching Maisonette Creator

## Download and unzip

- Download the Maisonette Creator for your operating system. 

- Unzip the .zip file into a folder of your choice.

If you are reading this documentation, you might have
already completed these steps. Congratulations!

## Windows

(todo)

- Go to the sub-folder "app"

- Double-click "nw.exe"

- If Windows tells you that this app is not signed,
click trust or similar.

## Linux

- Run the executable named "nw", either by double-clicking it or via terminal:

    $ ./nw --password-store=basic

- If this does not work, you have to give "nw" permission to be executed.
On Ubuntu and Linux Mint you should be able
to do this:
    - right-click the file "nw" in the file explorer
    - -> properties -> permissions
    - check the checkbox "allow this file to run as a program"

Alternatively look up the Linux command "chmod".

## Mac

(todo)

- The app is unsigned; you have to explicitly allow it to run:

# Getting started with Maisonette Creator

## Ways to use Maisonette

There are two ways to create Maisonette games.

The simple way is to just start typing inside
Maisonette Creator's built-in editor.

The second (more advanced) way is to use a
text editor of your choice.

## Method 1: Using Maisonette's built-in editor
When you start Maisonette Creator, you should
see an editor in the left part of the window.
You can write your story code here.
(The story is written in 
a language I call MaisonetteScript.)
Whenever you save, Maisonette Creator
builds a working game from your story code
and lets you test the game in the right-hand pane.

When you choose this method, you are limited
to one MaisonetteScript file per game. (But that's
not a big issue. If your game grows really big,
you can still switch to Method 2 later.)

## Method 2: Using an external editor
You can use a text editor that is suited
for writing code. (Word processors like Microsoft Word or
LibreOffice aren't text editors, but word processors. They are not suited
for this task.) Visual Studio Code and SublimeText are good editors,
but there are many more.

Inside the Maisonette Creator, create a new project.
Maisonette will create the project inside the folder:
"app/projects/your-project-name".

If you navigate to this folder, you will see
that a "story.zzz" file has already been created for you.

(MaisonetteScript files should always have the extension ".zzz"
The "story.zzz" file always counts as the main MaisonetteScript file,
and it must be present in each project.)

Leave Maisonette Creator open
and edit "story.zzz" in your favourite editor.

Save the file. Once you save, Maisonette Creator automatically
builds your game and shows it in the right-hand panel.

You can create more ".zzz" files in the same folder,
as well as JavaScript files (extension ".js") and css files
(extension ".css").

Then in your "story.zzz" file, you can do:

    #title My Story
    #author Sarah Brown
    #add chapter1.zzz
    #add chapter2.zzz
    #add a-javascript-file.js
    #add another-maisonette-script-file.zzz
    #add style.css
    #add my-fancy-boxes.css
    #add another-css-file.css

etc.

The files will be loaded in the
order you specify them
("story.zzz" will always be loaded as the first file).

An important note: The files cannot be inside nested sub-folders of
your Maisonette project folder, or Maisonette Creator won't
recognize them. DO NOT DO THIS:

    #add some-sub-folder/chapter1.zzz

Yet another note: always save your Maisonette files with UTF-8 encoding!


# Basics of MaisonetteScript

MaisonetteScript is the language used to create Maisonette games. This
documentation will guide you through MaisonetteScript's features.

### Text blocks

The first thing you have to know about MaisonetteScript
is that **you should use backticks (\`) to
enclose text**.

Short detour: Sometimes you might see
examples where text is enclosed in quotes (") or apostrophes
('). This is fine for simple, single-line texts,
but breaks immediately once the text spans several lines
(and in other cases it breaks, too).
Whenever you see a MaisonetteScript example using quotes
or apostrophes consider it a bad habit carried
over from another programming language (I have that
habit unfortunately, but I'm trying to get rid of it.)
If you see an example using quotes in this documentation,
I apologize.

**Remember: the easiest and best way is to always use backticks
to enclose text blocks!**

If typing a backtick
is annoying on your keyboard layout, the Maisonette editor
has a special short-cut for that: CTRL + B.

A simple example:

    #function start
        say \`It was a dark
            and stormy
            night ...\`

This prints a text at the beginning of our game.
Note how we can write text over several lines and with indentation.
Maisonette automatically prints it properly.

## Rooms

MaisonetteScript files consist of so-called blocks. A # (hashtag/pound) symbol
at the beginning of a new line starts a new block. There are several
types of blocks like "#function" blocks, "#thing" blocks, "#room" blocks and others.
Let's start with rooms.

The world of a Maisonette game is made up of rooms. This is how
you define a room:

    #room forest
        title: "In the Forest"
        look: "You are lost in a deep, dark forest."

Note that the indentation is completely optional.

## Things

Things are simply the things your game world is made of.
You can assign arbitrary properties to things.
This is how you define a thing with some properties:

    #thing bottle
    name: "bottle of wine"
    age: 14
    delicious: yes
    expensive: no

Each thing property must be written on its own line.
Texts must be enclosed by " (or alternatively by ' or \`).
Numbers and the special values **yes** and **no** are NOT enclosed
by apostrophes.

(If you are a coder: **yes** and **no** are booleans
and equivalent to **true** and **false**.)

## Verbs

Verbs are actions the player can take.
The player can only do things we defined before.
That's how you define a new verb:

    #verb lift
    name: 'lift'

Now that we learned what things and verbs are, we can
move on to rules and start doing some interesting stuff.

## Basic Use of Specific do-rules

Maisonette's rules system is inspired by Inform 7,
but is way more simplistic (which can be both a good
and a bad thing, I guess?)

### Displaying a text as a result of a player action

So-called 'do-rules' define what is going to happen when the player takes
a certain action. A very simple rule could look like this:

    #do drink bottle
    You won't be able to sell the bottle if it's empty!

This will display the appropriate text when the player
tries to drink the bottle.

### Running code as a result of a player action

Let's add something to the example from before:

    #do drink bottle

    You won't be able to sell the bottle if it's empty!

    run:
        score = score - 100

- The **run:** block must appear **after** the text block.

- The **run:** block can contain arbitrary MaisonetteScript code (actually
sugar-coated JavaScript) and can perform all sorts of complex operations.
In this case however, we just detract 100 points from the player's score
for trying to drink the wine.

### Conditional rule blocks

Rule blocks can also have an additional
if-condition that specifies
when the rule applies. You must use lower-case "if"
(NOT: "If") and the line must appear as the first line in the block (and
the condition cannot span more than one line):

    # stop drink bottle
    if player_thirsty = yes

    You won't be able to sell the bottle if it's empty!

    run:
        score = score - 100

Meaning: if the variable "player_thirsty" is set to yes, trying to drink the bottle
will lead to the expected result. **If the variable "player_thirsty" is not set to
yes, however, the player will not even
be presented with the option to drink the bottle!**

Of course, we could now add another rule that allows the player to try to drink
the bottle even when they are not thirsty, and leads to a different result:

    #do drink bottle
    if player_thirsty = no

    You aren't even thirsty!

    run:
        score = score - 20

### do-rules trigger only once

By default, do-rules apply only once. If you write:

    #do drink bottle
    You take a sip of beer. It tastes stale.

... then the player will only be able to drink
from the bottle once. In fact, after drinking once from the bottle,
the option to drink won't even be suggested to the player anymore:
when you click on the "bottle" link, the
option "drink" simply won't appear in the
dropdown anymore!

Maisonette has a bias towards unique options, so to speak.
Unless you tell Maisonette otherwise, it will assume
that do-rules are to be executed only once (and crucially: this means
they will also be **suggested** only once.)

Let's look at another example:

    #do drink bottle
    You take a sip of beer. It tastes stale.

    #do drink bottle
    You take another sip of beer. It starts tasting better.

    #do drink bottle
    You take a third sip of beer. You are starting to feel tipsy.

This does pretty much what you would expect. The rules
are executed in order of their appearance. 
The first time we drink, the first rule triggers and
is eliminated. The second time we drink, the second rule
triggers, etc... After we drink for the third time,
the drinking action won't be suggested anymore.

This will allow us to drink an endless amount of beer, without
any repercussions:

    #do drink bottle #multi
    You take a sip of beer. It tastes stale.

Thanks to the **#multi** tag, the rule will trigger
over and over again.

### The "props" block

Finally, rules support a "props:" block. This is not used
very often, but can be useful in some cases.
A "props:" block assigns arbitrary properties to a rule,
kind of as if the rule were a thing.
These properties do not mean anything unless we write
some custom code that uses them.

    #do drink bottle #multi
    You take a sip of beer. It tastes stale.

    props:
        beer_related_rule: yes
        this_is_a_rule_i_want_to_remove_later: yes
        action_cost_for_this_rule: 350
        rule_description: "This rule is pretty boring."
        some_other_meaningless_property: 42

## Basic Use of Generic Rules

### Defining Generic Rules

Most rules in your game will probably be 'do-rules'
with a fixed verb and thing, like the "drink beer" example
we saw before. These are great for creating specific
responses and drive the narrative forward.

But sometimes we want more generic rules.
For example we might want to answer to a whole set of
player commands in the same or at least in a similar way.

Consider this example:

    #verb lift
    name: 'lift'

    #do lift sword
    if player_is_weak = yes
    You feel too weak to pick it up.

    #do lift shield
    if player_is_weak = yes
    You feel too weak to pick it up.

    #do lift armor
    if player_is_weak = yes
    You feel too weak to pick it up.

This works, but it's a bit verbose. (Especially
if you add 300 more things.)

Let's try a clever little trick. First we
have to define a generic rule by using an asterisk (*):

    #verb lift
    name: 'lift'

    #do lift *
    if player_is_weak = yes
    You feel too weak to pick it up.

The asterisk matches any thing. But this is not enough yet.
We told Maisonette **what** to do when the player
tries to lift a thing, but Maisonette won't **suggest**
the lifting option to us. Unlike with
**specific** do-actions, Maisonette assumes
that **generic** do-actions are way too boring to automatically
suggest them to the player.

We have to explicitly suggest them. We do this
by adding a so-called 'option block':

    #verb lift
    name: 'lift'

    #do lift *
    if player_is_weak = yes
    You feel too weak to pick it up.

    #option
    add_option("lift", thing)

That's it. The option block adds the
"lift" verb to **all** things. It will appear
in every dropdown.

Also, because the  rule "lift *" is generic,
it will be triggered multiple times, not just once
(you don't need to set **#multi** on generic rules).

There is a caveat, though. We already mentioned that rules
run in order (from top to bottom). Let's add another rule before
our generic asterisk rule:

    #verb lift
    name: 'lift'

    #do lift sword
    You are strong enough, but
    you are a pacifist and do not carry weapons.

    #do lift *
    if player_is_weak = yes
    You feel too weak to pick it up.

    #option
    add_option("lift")

The "take sword" rule runs before the "take *" rule,
simply because of the fact that it appeared before it.
So when you try taking the sword, you are informed
that you are capable of carrying the sword but don't
want to. Then the rule is discarded, because it ran
already (it is specific and has no #multi set). The next 
time we try lifting the sword, the "lift *" rule
kicks in and tells us we are too weak.

This is clearly wrong. The obvious fix would be
to reorder the rules. That's fine for small
games, but can be tedious for bigger ones.

A better approach would be to use
a "before"-rule. See the next section.

### before-rules

Let's rewrite the example from the last chapter
with a before rule:

    #verb lift
    name: 'lift'

    #do lift sword
    You are strong enough, but
    you are a pacifist and do not carry weapons.

    #before lift *
    if player_is_weak = yes
    You feel too weak to pick it up.

    #option
    add_option("lift")

Before-rules always run before do-rules.

That means the "#before lift *" will run before the "#do lift sword"
rule, even if it appeared later in the file.

### non-stopping before-rules

There's also the case where we want to print something
before something else happens.

    #before eat *
    (You know you shouldn't, but you just cannot resist.
    You have to eat [the thing].)
    run:
        return carry_on

    #do eat apple
    You take a bite. Yummy!

    #do eat cake
    You eat the cake. It tastes good!

Now we will see the line in parentheses
printed in front of the actual eating text.

Note the use of a run sub-block and of the line: "return carry_on".
This may seem a bit cryptic, but all it really does
is telling Maisonette to "keep the action running", so to speak.
Without the "return carry_on" line, the rule would
trigger and end the turn; subsequent rules would not be considered.
With the "return carry_on" the rule still triggers but does
not stop the action.

### carry_out-rules

You will probably use carry_out rules
less often than do and before rules. 
You use a carry_out rule when you want to handle
something in a generic way, **after** (and **only if**)
all of the preceding before and do rules failed.

For example you might do:

    #carry_out photograph *
        You take a picture of [the thing].

### Rule Ordering

Basically, every rule belongs to a phase: before rules belong
to the before phase, do rules belong to the do phase, etc.

Once the player takes an action those phases
are run in succession. Inside each phase the rules
are run in the order they were defined in (from top to bottom).
Note that (unlike in Inform 7) specificity does **NOT** affect
rule order! A rule like "take *" would be less specific
than a rule like "take fish", but that does not matter for ordering.
Only phase and appearance in the file do, with earlier
definitions trumping later ones. And phase
**always** takes precedence over order of appearance in the file.

This is the order of the phases:

- 1. before
- 2. do
- 3. carry_out
- (3.5: lib_carry_out: library, do not use)
- 4. report
- (4.5: lib_report: library, do not use)
- 5. after

For your own custom verbs you will probably mostly
use before-rules and do-rules, and sometimes
maybe a carry_out rule.

The two remaining phases are mostly
for interfacing with verbs that
are already predefined by Maisonette (like "take"
and a few others.)

### after-rules

After-rules only run if no rule before has stopped the action.
They run after Maisonette prints its standard success message.

    #after take apple_of_discord
    You did it! Well done!
    run:
    score = score + 100

This will print something along the lines of: "You take the apple of
discord. You did it! Well done!"

### report-rules

You use a report-rule when you want Maisonette to handle
an action, but want to report the action with a custom text,
instead of the boring standard text:

    #report take broom
    As you pick up the magic broom, it buzzes lightly.


## option blocks

### option blocks philosophy
We have already looked at option blocks briefly, but
they are capable of doing a lot more.

First off, let's clarify a few things.
Option blocks are **NOT** rules. They have
a different syntax and they behave differently. Like we saw earlier,
rules are divided into phases.
Once the player takes an action those phases
are run in succession until a rule triggers. Option blocks
instead are considered before the player
even does anything. They decide what options
the player has, i.e. what verbs will be presented
to the player.

We have to note an important thing here: specific
rules like "take torch" or "open chest", i.e.
rules that apply to one specific thing, do **NOT**
need to be enabled by an option block. Instead,
they are automatically enabled by Maisonette.

The idea is that if you write, say:

    #do smell cheese
        It smells like Switzerland.

That's of course an answer you want the player to see.
There is no need to tell Maisonette explicitly to enable
the answer in the verb dialogue once you click on "cheese".
I think this is a very cool feature of Maisonette
that (hopefully) saves the game author a lot of time.

It's different for generic rules like "take *".
Here Maisonette cannot be so sure when you want
the verb to be suggested, so it default to: never show the option
unless instructed by an option block to do so.

### option blocks Basic Usage

This is the most basic usage of an option block:

    #option
    add_option("lift", thing)

This adds the verb "lift" to every thing in the game.
Now when you click on a thing you will always see
the option "lift".

But option blocks can be more sophisticated. This
only adds the option if a condition is met:

    #option
        if player.hungry = yes and thing.edible = yes
            add_option(eat, thing)
        end

Unlike with rules, when an option block is executed
is doesn't stop the execution of the following
option blocks. This will add an "eat" option
to all things when the player is hungry;
and it will add an "eat" option to the cake,
even when the player is not hungry:

    #thing apple
    edible: yes

    #thing cake
    edible: yes

    #option
        if player.hungry = yes and thing.edible = yes
            add_option(eat, thing)
        end

    #option
        if thing = cake
            add_option(eat, thing)
        end

Note how the first option block does not stop the next one.
You might notice something: when the player is hungry
the option to eat will be added **twice** to the cake.
But the good news is that
Maisonette is smart enough to only show the "eat" option
once in the verb selection dialogue.

### options with higher priority

If an action is very important, you may want
it to show up at the very top of the options list:

    #option
        if thing = cake
            add_option(eat, thing, 100)
        end

This gives the option "eat the cake"
a priority of 100. It will show up above
options like "take cake" etc.

Priorities must be integers. Please write them as plain numbers,
not as text enclosed with quotes. (100 **NOT:** "100")
The default priority for actions is 10 for generic actions
and 20 for specific actions. Anything higher than 20
goes to the top of the list. Anything lower than 10
will be regarded as an action of lesser importance
and will show up at the very bottom of the list (or possibly
won't show up at all if the display settings in your game
are set to cap the list after a certain amount of entries).
The priority number must be in the range -1000
to +1000.

### options with custom text

Normally you will see the verb name in the options dialogue.
But you can do this:

    #thing goat
    animal: yes

    #option
        if thing.animal = yes
            add_option(touch, thing, 100, "gently pet the goat")
        end

Note that if you add a custom text, you also **have** to add
a priority number.

### removing options and the "final" keyword

You can also remove options:

    #option
        if thing.edible = no
            remove_option(eat, thing)
        end

remove_option does not allow specifying a
custom text or priority, it just removes the option altogether.

Later option blocks could re-enable the eating option, though.
But you can prevent this by doing:

    #option
        if thing.edible = no
            remove_option(eat, thing, final)
        end

The "final" keyword freezes the thing's option state.
Later option blocks do still run and can add and remove
other things to the options, but they cannot
enable "eat" for the things that were matched anymore
(all edible things
in this case).
    
Likewise, you can use final for add_option, too:

    #option
        if thing = goat
            add_option(touch, thing, final, 100, "gently pet the goat")
        end

or just:

    #option
        if thing = goat
            add_option(touch, thing, final)
        end

Note: The 'final' keyword is optional, but if it appears
in an add_option or a remove_option it has to be the **third** parameter
(the third word separated by commas), i.e. it must appear before priority.


## Global Variables
Variables are identifiers that can hold numbers or texts
or even a reference to a room or a thing. Global means
that a variable can be used anywhere in your story.
Here is how you define global variables:

    #thing cake

    #var x = 404
    #var my_text = "Some text ..."
    #var a_thing = cake

Note that the line "#var a_thing = cake" is just for demonstration
purposes. Usually it would make more sense to first create the variable
"a_thing" with some value like "no" and assign it the thing later. We will
cover how to do that later on.

## Beginning your story: the start function

Here is how you print a text of the beginning of your story:

    #function start
        say (\`It was a dark and stormy night ...\`)

## Code Blocks

### Introduction

We have already looked at "run:" sub-blocks (inside rule blocks)
and at the "#function start" block.

What these two have in common is that they
don't execute some custom Maisonette code, but actually
run pure JavaScript code! This may come as a shock,
but I cheated a bit when I said that MaisonetteScript is a
scripting language in its own right. Actually it's just
a pretty layer that hides JavaScript.

This has the obvious disadvantage that it makes
it pretty much impossible to run
Maisonette games without a program that understands JavaScript.
But there are also big advantages to this approach:

    - Your games will run in the browser. This makes distributing them easy.

    - You have the whole power of JavaScript at your fingertips:
    adding images, audio and even video to your game becomes easy,
    and the sky becomes the limit.

Furthermore, Maisonette sugar-coats JavaScript, so it's
more bearable for both beginners and advanced programmers
that happen to hate curly braces. MaisonetteScript makes
a few changes to JavaScript
that make it look more like Ruby or Basic
(or like Python, but without the silly indentation
rules; there, I said it). In the following section
we will learn the basics of writing logic, but no JavaScript
knowledge is required at all! You will see that
Maisonette code is pretty straightforward and readable.

### If conditions

This is how you use an if-condition:

    #do touch statue
        run:
            if lever_was_pressed = yes and red_button_was_pushed = yes
                say \`Silently, the statue glides to the side.
                    Behind it, you see a dark passage.\`
                    dark_passage_open = yes
            else
                say \`Nothing happens.\`
            end

The indentation helps you see the structure better
and is recommended, but Maisonette does not care whether
you indent or not. The "else" block is optional.

When the if-condition does only one thing, you can abbreviate it to:

    #do touch *
        run:
            say \`You touch it.\`
            if thing.is_made_of_metal: say \`It feels cold.\`

Note how we have to use a colon (:) here to separate the condition
from the outcome. Also, there is no "end" keyword; the outcome block
ends automatically with the end of the line.

### Loops

Maisonette has two types of loops. "each" loops over a list:

    ...
    run:
        let list = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
        each item in list
            say \`The next number is [item].\`
        end

"loop" loops over a thing's properties:

    #thing man
        age: 37
        name: "Dave"
        living: yes

    ...
    run:
        loop key in man
            let value = man[key]
            say \`[key] has the value: [value].\`
        end

### Functions
todo to do


### Text Substitutions Inside Rules

Inside rule blocks you can do text substitution like:
[the thing] ...





## Relations

## If-Conditions inside Text-Blocks

## TinteScript



## Strings in run blocks

Some text must be enclosed between quotes. Whenever that is the case,
you can use one of these three characters: \` or ' or ".

However **only** text blocks enclosed with the backtick (\`)
character can span multiple lines.






# Text Output and Visuals

## Output boxes

You can show text in different areas of the HTML page.

Maisonette calls these areas "boxes".

Use the command 'box' to define what output box should
currently be used. These are the allowed commands:

- box("main") ----- Outputs text to the main box (the center bottom box).

- box("main-top") ----- Outputs text to the center top box (above the main box).

- box("top") ----- Outputs text to the top box.

- box("bottom") ----- Outputs text to the bottom box.

- box("left") ----- Outputs text to the left box.

- box("right") ----- Outputs text to the right box.

Example:

    #function start
    box("left")
    say(\`I am on the left-hand side.\`)
    box("right")
    say(\`I am on the right-hand side.\`)
    say(\`So am I!\`)
    box("main")
    say(\`I'm in the middle.\`)

## Custom output areas (experimental)

This is an experimental feature. It can be changed or removed
at any time.

You can output text to custom HTML divs (or even to other elements.)

Example:

    box("left")
    say ("I am left.")

    world_manager.create_stream("my-stream", "my-custom-div")
	stream_manager.set_stream("my-stream")
	say ("I am inside a custom HTML element!")

Note that for custom areas you have
to use 'stream_manager.set_stream' instead of box.

## Page Styler

The simplest way to style your game is to
use Maisonette's "styler" module. 
The styler offers some simple options to customize the looks
of your game. If you need more advanced options, you can always drop
custom CSS or JS into your game;
but for starting out, you can just use the styler functions,
they should be fine for the most basic styling needs.

styler commands are called like so: styler.a_command( ... parameters ...)

What follows is a list of all styler commands.

### styler.set
name: styler.set

what it does: sets a color or other style property

example: styler.set("main background color", "black")

parameters:
1. parameter: A valid option string (see below).

2. parameter: A valid color code string for colors, otherwise
a value like "4px" or similar. Colors can be HTML color names, or they
can be written in rgb, rgba or hex notation (just like CSS).
Note the American spelling (writing "colour" is not allowed).

These are all valid option strings:

- "main background color": Sets the main background color.

- "main foreground color": Sets the main foreground color.

- "panels border color": sets the color of the borders separating the text panels
from each other. If the text panels have a white background, a light grey tone is recommended for "panels border color", but you can use whatever you want.

- "top bar background color": The small bar on top: background color.

- "top bar foreground color": The small bar on top: foreground color.

- "bottom bar background color": Same for the bottom bar.

- "bottom bar foreground color": Same for the bottom bar.

- "image panel border color": Redundant. Use styler.set_image_panel, instead.

- "thing button background color": Thing button refers to what you may call a
link. This sets the background color.

- "thing button foreground color": And the foreground color.

- "thing button background color hover": This sets the hover (mouse-over) background color.

- "thing button foreground color hover": And the foreground color.

- "verb selector background color": Background color for the dropdown box from which you
select verbs.

- "verb selector foreground color": And foreground color.

- "verb selector hover background color": Same for hover/mouse-over.

- "verb selector hover foreground color": See above.

- "verb selector border color": Dropdown box border color.

- "verb selector border radius": Use a value like "4px" to make the edges
round, "0px" to make them normal (rectangular).

Note: Changing colors during the game should be okay, but hasn't been thoroughly
tested, yet.

### styler.hide_image_panel

name: styler.hide_image_panel

example:  styler.hide_image_panel()

parameters: no

what it does: hides the image panel

Note: It should be okay to hide and (re)show the panel during the game.

***

### styler.show_image_panel

name: styler.show_image_panel

example:  styler.show_image_panel()

parameters: no

what it does: shows the image panel

***

### styler.set_image_panel

name: styler.set_image_panel

example: styler.set_image_panel("50%", "8px", "blue")

what it does: sets the style of the image panel

parameters:
1. radius: This sets rounded edges for the image. The unit should
be "px" or "rem" or "%":

    - "0px": no rounded edges

    - "8px": slightly rounded edges.

    - "50%": completely round: circle

2. border-size: string defining the width of the border around the image. The unit
should be "px" or "rem", for example: "4px". Use "0px" for no border at all.

3. border-color: string with HTML color, defines the color of the border
around the image.

***

### styler.set_page_max_width

name: styler.set_page_max_width

example: styler.set_page_max_width(1600)

what it does: sets maximum width of the page

parameters:
1. A number.

Normally, your game fills the entire width of the HTML page.
On a big screen this might not look good, though; the columns
may be just too wide. This command sets a maximum width for the page
in pixels. If the player's screen is bigger than this maximum
value, the game won't fill the entire screen width, instead
you will see an empty space on the left and right side of the screen
(the empty space has the normal background color and shouldn't
be visually irritating.)

Note: Pass a number to this function, not a string.

DO: styler.set_page_max_width(1600)

DON'T: styler.set_page_max_width("1600px")

Note: The default page max width is 1280. You probably don't need to change it.

***

### styler.set_columns

name: styler.set_columns

example: set_columns("26%", "48%", "26%")

what it does: This sets the width of the three columns from left to right.

parameters:
1. Left column width in percent
2. Center column width in percent
3. Right column width in percent

If you want to hide a column entirely, use "0%". The middle column is considered
the main column and cannot be hidden.

Note: The values must add up to exactly 100%.

Note: Do not use "px" or "rem" values. Only percent values are allowed here.

***

### styler.set_center_rows
name: styler.set_center_rows

example: set_center_rows("40%", "60%", "1.8rem")

what it does: The center column has two panels, one at the top, one at the bottom.
This sets the size of these panels.

parameters:

1. Top center panel height in percent

2. Bottom center panel height in percent

3. Space between top and center panel in "rem": has to be between "0.0rem" and "2.0rem"

Note: Set the top center panel height to "0%" to hide it entirely. The bottom center panel
is considered the main center panel and cannot be hidden.

Note: The first two values have to add up to 100%.

Note: The space between the two panels is subtracted from the top panel,
so if you do: 'set_center_rows("50%", "50%", "1.5rem")', the two panels
won't be exactly equal in height, instead the top one will be a tiny bit smaller
to account for the space in between. (Its height will be: 50% of the center column height minus 1.5 rem, where "1rem" is the standard font size.)

***

### styler.set_scrollbar_style

name: styler.set_scrollbar_style

example: styler.set_scrollbar_style("modern", "#ddd", "#888")

what it does: This tries to set the scrollbar style for your game.

Parameters:

1. Style name. Must be one of the following strings: "modern", "minimal"
or "minimal-rounded"

2. Trackbar color (background): HTML color

3. Track thumb color (foreground): HTML color

Important: this does not work 100%, because
the browser support for setting scrollbar style is simply
insufficient. The trackbar color and track thumb color
setting should work on Webkit browsers
(like Chrome and others) and also on Firefox. The style setting will only
work on Webkit browsers. Other browsers may ignore this setting completely.
If you want your game to just use the normal native scrollbars (different
on each OS), simply do not call this function.

Styles:

- "modern": a glossy-looking scrollbar

- "minimal": a minimalistic, rectangle-shaped scrollbar, might be good for a retro look

- "minimal-rounded": same as minimalistic, but with rounded corners

***

### styler.set_root_font_size

name: styler.set_root_font_size

example: styler.set_root_font_size("0.5rem")

what it does: scales all text on the page up or down

parameters:
1. new size of the root font. Use "rem" units.

Note: The default root font size set by styler is "0.875rem", which should translate
to "14px" on most browsers. If, for example, if you
call 'styler.set_root_font_size("1.0rem")' the font size will go up to 16 pixels.

Note: This should only be called once at the beginning of the game
(in your 'start' function). Don't call this
during the game or it will interfere with accessibility settings.

Note: This is different than a browser's zoom feature, because it just scales
the text, not the entire page layout.
